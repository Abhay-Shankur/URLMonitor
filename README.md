# URLMonitor
The project integrates a Chrome extension and Flask server for enhanced web security. It monitors visited URLs, sending them to the server for protection checks. If a URL is protected, users are redirected to a login or QR code page for authentication. Firebase is used for real-time data storage. The extension ensures a secure browsing experience.
